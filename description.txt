A mod that adds an item which allows autoswing for all items when favourited in the player's inventory.

The item is called the Hallowed Metronome and is crafted from 10 Dynasty Wood, 8 Souls of Light, 8 Souls of Night, 8 Hallowed Bars, and a 1-Second Timer at a Mythril/Orichalcum Anvil.

This mod is open source and is available here: https://github.com/LucidSigma/HallowedMetronome
