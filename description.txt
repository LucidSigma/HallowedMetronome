A mod that adds items which allow autoswing for all items.

The first item is called the Hellstone Metronome and is crafted from 10 Dynasty Wood, 8 Hellstone Bars, and a 1-Second Timer at an Anvil. This is an accessory that will allow autoswing for all items when equipped.
The second item is called the Hallowed Metronome and is crafted from a Hellstone Metronome, 8 Souls of Light, 8 Souls of Night, and 8 Hallowed Bars at a Mythril/Orichalcum Anvil. This is an item that allows autoswing for all items when favourited in the player's inventory.

This mod is intended as an alternative to mods such as OmniSwing for people who prefer allowing the player to "unlock" global autoswing rather than having it enabled from the start.

By default, most weapons are allowed. Items can be allowed/disallowed in the mod's configuration settings.

This mod is open source and is available here: https://github.com/LucidSigma/HallowedMetronome
